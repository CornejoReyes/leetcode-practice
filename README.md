# My daily (almost) practice of algorithms in LeetCode.

Hi! I'm Fernando Cornejo, a software engineer, specialized in web and mobile development.

As part of my career, I try to practice (daily if I can) algorithms to develop my problem-solving abilities.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a platform for learning and practice code. Also serves a training partner if you want to join big tech companies as Google, Amazon, etc.

My goals with this project are:

- Practice logic, problem-solving and code theory.
- Create a habit of always practice.
- Improve my programming and algorithm bases.
- Inspire other developers to do the same, or at least try.

Solutions posted in this repo are not the best, optimal or the only posible solution. The objective of solutions is just to solve the problem in a "correct" manner.

So don't expect the solutions to be awesome, top 1%, etc. Remember that most of the time is just me practicing, not competing.

Each folder is named as the title of the problem described in LeetCode. Inside, you will find a `description.md` file, where the problem is well defined, a `solution` file, which contain the code to solve the problem, mainly in TypeScript, but other langs are also used, and probably a `pdf` file with my thought process, drawings, diagrams, schemas and all the things I did for solving the problem in paper.
